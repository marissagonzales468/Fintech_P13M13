## Neural Network Model
This application is based on a binary classification model using a deep neural network to predict whether Alphabet Soup funding applicants will be successful. The model pre-processes the data compling the data using the best methodolgies for the most accurate results!
# Technologies
* [keras](https://keras.io/about/) - For developing neural networks faster and easier.
* [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) -For help structuring machine learning networks.

# Installation Guide
Before running the application first install the following dependencies.
```python
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
python -c "import tensorflow as tf;print(tf.__version__)"
python -c "import tensorflow as tf;print(tf.keras.__version__)"
```
# Usage
To calculate the future data 
```python
open 'google colab'
upload the jupyter file you wish to work on
```
Upon launching the 'GC_venture_funding_with_deep_learning' you will be greeted with the following prompts.
